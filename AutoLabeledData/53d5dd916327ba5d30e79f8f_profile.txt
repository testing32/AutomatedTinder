I touch beards on the first date.  Will go out of my way to step on a particularly crunchy looking leaf.  If I stumble upon Braveheart on tv, I can't not watch it.  That's like changing the station during Bohemian Rhapsody- you just don't.  Love traveling, trying new foods, festivals, live music, trivia.  Love my bulldog, even when he farts then immediately leaves the room. Jerk.
