Hello, I'm 5' 4" vegetarian girl. I'm very social, love trying new restaurants, going out with friends, movies & bonfires. Just need to say I'm not here for hook ups or FWB. A little more about me: I'm originally from India, I am a practicing Catholic.  I'm an engineer, but not socially awkward LOL.  Looking forward to meeting someone like-minded. Have a nice day!
