Urban Dictionary defines Shannon as:	Shannon is usually a fun loving dark haired girl with dark eyes. She can sometimes be shy but once she comes out her shell she is crazy! She always has one boy that she loves (normally older) and she will obsess over him. She is very talented and will quite often burst out in a song. Shannon is known for being a bit on the dirty minded side but that is why people love her.Someone who is beautiful, inside and out. She's down to earth and crazy but you can't figure her out, which makes you love her all the more. They are truly a unique person and one of a kind  Haha, I would say Urban Dictionary is pretty dead on :)
