"Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me." - Michael Scott Ideal first date: "Oh I don't know. My cousins got a kickass mud pit in his back yard. You can watch me do belly flops. Then maybe we could get some Thai food and a tank of nitrous and see what happens."My ideal man wears Velcro shoes, white tube socks, a fedora, a satin shirt with a dragon printed on it, & white sunglasses with rinestones who likes to yell at me in Walmart.
