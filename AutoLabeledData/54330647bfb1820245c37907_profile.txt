Recently moved to Raleigh from VA and here to meet new people. I work in a Greenhouse doing BioAg research. I have a 3 year old German Shepherd who is a big baby. I like hiking, kayaking, shooting (bow and gun depending on my mood), and dancing. I'm not looking to hookup so keep looking if that's what you're after.
