Sure...why the hell not??? Looking to have fun with someone when I actually have time to relax! If you have shirtless selfies, selfies with your cats, corny color run pics, or you are shorter than 5'11......I promise I won't be interested. I work with kids, getting my MA in counseling, I LOVE to run, drink beer, and I have a sarcastic immature side ;) Okay that's all. Not my kid in pic ;)
