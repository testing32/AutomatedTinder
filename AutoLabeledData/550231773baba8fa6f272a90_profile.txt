A simple gal who loves a good funk, hip hop, soul or reggae track on a daily. I spin records when the mood strikes. I cook like a top chef. I treat animals like royalty. I'm grateful for my community of friends and family who make me smile constantly. I'm looking for an equally quirky partner in fun. Someone who is up for a spontaneous adventure but can also appreciate that I can plan like a boss. Someone to share a nice bottle of wine and charcuterie with while talking till the bar kicks us out
