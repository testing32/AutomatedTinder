NY ->Philly -> Tulsa -> Raleigh. Just moved here last week and looking to meet new people. Educated (MBA), career oriented (Accountant), brutally honest, love witty banter and I'm a total goofball. Never married and have no kids. Looking for the same in a man. Turn-ons include a great sense of humor, intellect, a great smile/set of teeth, and having your life together. I'm 5'11"...that limits the dating pool a little huh?!? :)
