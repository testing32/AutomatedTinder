New to Asheville. Let's ride bikes and drink beer and whisk(e)y. I make awesome ice cream. My moustache is better than yours. I don't care how tall you are. "I like flaws and feel more comfortable around people who have them. I myself am made entirely of flaws stitched together with good intentions." ~Augusten Burroughs
