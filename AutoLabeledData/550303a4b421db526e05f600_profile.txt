I'm an adventurous free spirit who loves to travel, yummy cocktails, and live shows/festivals. I persue happiness daily. No kids, never married. I live for today and laugh often. Smile!!! I hate ignorance. I love yoga, real food, and animals. Witty, smart, competitive. I'm looking for a funny guy that enjoys drinks, dinner, outdoor shows, laughter. Must love pets! No cigs or shyness plz. I'm open to new and fun ppl :) I want to laugh and not hear sad stories. Life's a game, play it! Cheers!
