Hope to find a person i can share a life with, preferably someone who is stable and motivated. I love animals, I own a horse and have two dogs. I love the outdoors, going out to eat, having a couple beers. I'm always down for a good time, whether that entails staying in or going out.  If you think you have what I'm looking for feel free to swipe right!
