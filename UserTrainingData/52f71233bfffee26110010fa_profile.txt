I enjoy living life. I have no regrets I mean that is how we define ourselves right? By making mistakes and learning. I am crazy obsessed with my pups. They have shoes and I'm not ashamed. I like to laugh,I find myself doing that A LOT. I don't like playing games. I've always thought honesty was the best policy...Cliche I know, but true! Karaoke is my jam! I'm always up for a night in the town My passion is to paint and create. I find it to be the most therapeutic thing ever.
