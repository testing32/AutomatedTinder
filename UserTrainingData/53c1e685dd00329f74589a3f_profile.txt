Originally from GA. Went to USC (SoCal). Work in healthcare. I  music (especially country), football, traveling, driving too fast w/ the windows down, cooking, making homemade lemonade, Jesus & Elvis Presley. I hate dishonestly & laziness, except for occasional vacations/weekends. I'm a big fan of southern gentlemen (mostly the gentlemen part) & traditional gender roles. Oh, & in case you didn't notice, I have curves. So if you can't handle them, don't bother. Not a random hookup kind of girl.
