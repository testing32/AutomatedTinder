I like my men like I like my coffee, tall and strong  Hahaha! I know, it's corny. I've learned from this online dating thing that most of you men don't know what you want. You say you want a relationship but your actions say another. If you're not serious, please keep it moving. I don't have time for nonsense. "A wise girl kisses but doesn't love, listens but doesn't believe, and leaves before she is left. ~Marilyn Monroe
