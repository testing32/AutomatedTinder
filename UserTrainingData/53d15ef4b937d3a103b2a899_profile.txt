I'm addicted to coffee and sunshine.  I am agnostic. Forgiveness is not always a requirement, but loyalty and honesty are non-negotiables.  Family is not always blood... and people will always show their true colors.  Don't waste time trying to repaint them.  Life is short.  Spread love and joy whenever you can.
