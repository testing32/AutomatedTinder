We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed~2 Corinthians 4:8-9I'm awesome. My dog is cooler than you. My sister is a ginger. I like to workout. I'm in grad school. My friends are cool. I like to tell jokes and laugh. I'm pretty unintentionally moody sometimes. I like things that work in systems and if there is a failure in the system I get angry. I have no middle ground. I like something or I don't. I hate doing things slow--driving, walking, talking...you know. I like hugs and high-fives. I make the best s'mores in the history of the world. I like the outside. I like naps. I like scary movies and thunderstorms. I recently found out that I really like playing in the rain. I hate tomatoes, maple syrup, salt, yams. I really like baby carrots, blueberry Cliff Bars, meatloaf, watermelon and grapes. I'm hopelessly and helplessly addicted to Diet Dr Pepper.
