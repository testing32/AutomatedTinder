I love to meet new people and go on adventures. Work moved me to Raleigh from Florida last year, and I really miss the sunshine! I like traveling, trying new food, and seeing live music. I take a trip somewhere about every month, I like to eat vegetables, and I listen to indie rock, alternative, and EDM. Not looking for a hookup. ENFP with a flexible and spontaneous personality. Am I supposed to write my height?
