I'm childlike in humor/personality, but wise in years. I try to think outside of the box.  I'm a firm believer in if you don't like it, change it.  I can't pronounce it, but I still believe chivalry exists in some form.   No kids, never married (aka unicorn). Sometimes I'm just on tinder to see if I can get to the end of it where it says "there's no one new around you" because then I feel like I've won.  Who doesn't like winning?PA->MD-> NC.  Currently live in Raleigh and love it!
