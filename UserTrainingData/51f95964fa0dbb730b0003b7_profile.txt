I am just an old fashioned southern NC girl. I am NOT on tinder to hook up, so if that is all you want please swipe left.  The little girl in the picture is not mine, just my beautiful God child that I am very proud of!  My true passion in life is traveling. I have been to culinary school abroad but rarely cook. I rescued a Beagle mix, but sometimes I think he rescued me - he makes any day better!
