South Dakota native, moved to NC 7 years ago. I finished grad school at UNC last summer and now work for a small pharmaceutical company. Likes: playing kickball, golfing, board games, hiking, camping, breweries, wine, and napping. I love to read and am well-versed in current events and sciencey things, but I'm horrible at the sports, movies, and music rounds of trivia. I'm 5'8"ish - prefer my height or taller!
