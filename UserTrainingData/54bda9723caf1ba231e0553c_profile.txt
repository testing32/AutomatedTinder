#swipeleftforwhatI love furniture shopping but not looking for one night stand.Short, quirky, chunky southern belle (who frequently uses a british accent). Big hair, big boobs, big heart. Love kayaking, hiking, adventures, plaid, dancing, ghost hunting & tall glasses of Duplin County wine. From time to time I dress up as other people and sing or dance.
