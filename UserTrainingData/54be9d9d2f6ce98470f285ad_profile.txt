Apex native but went to college in NYC and stayed for 11 years until moving back in 2012. I love life and trying new things. I enjoy a good meal and good wine but at the same time I can throw on jeans a tee and a baseball hat and partake in beer and every cheesy sport you can think of or a good sports game. I'm extremely down to earth and absolutely cannot stand drama!I'm looking for someone who enjoys the same and can hang and just have a good time drama free.
