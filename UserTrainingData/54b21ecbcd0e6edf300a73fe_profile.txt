I take  selfies and have an unstable tinder habit. I add, delete, and re-add the app sporadically. I delete it because I notice a disappointing trend amongst tinder men. I re-add it because I realize there is no meaning to life without disappointment & tinder. Separation anxiety typically sets in shortly after  I've laughed at enough memes, re-read enough redundant news stories, and giggled at enough of my own FB status updates because I'm awesome. Moral of profile-don't be a whore.
