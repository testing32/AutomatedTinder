They won't let me add all the languages I know which is English, Crappy Mandaring, Bar Gibberish and Workout Whimpering which I happen to be the best at. Intelligence is not to make no mistakes, but quickly to see how to make them good.Love traveling, cooking healthy versions of food, am an endurance / cardio junkie and have my PhD which will help me save the world :)Not looking for anything casual and if you are, please swipe left.Will welcome non sleazy cool friends though :)
