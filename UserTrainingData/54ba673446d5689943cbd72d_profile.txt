I'm a 33 year old legally-separated woman who resides in Cary, NC. I have an adorable 4 year old son who is my heart. I'm ready to move on with my life and possibly meet someone new. I studied opera performance in college and love all types of music. I love the outdoors, camping, hiking, the theater,museums, hanging out with friends and Seahawks football.
