Lover of Cleveland sports (yes, I'm happy LeBron is back & yes Manziel is a disappointment so far), laughing, being silly, ESPN, pets, craft beer, & play co-ed softball. If you're funny, considerate, & if one of your pics is of you smiling, you get bonus points. I'm not on here for "hookups" so keep swiping if you are. I was told to try this, so lets see how it goes. I'm not one to message first. Just sayin' :)
