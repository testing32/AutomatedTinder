I am an easy going, fun single girl trying to meet some new people outside my social circle.  I work in the health care field and when I am not at work I am spending with my friends, going to the movies, dancing, working in my vegetable garden, or relaxing on the couch watching TV.  I love to sleep in, traveling, and cheese.
