I love playing games (not with your heart). I'm a psychologist and love people, especially interesting or quirky people. I like smiling, smiling's my favorite. I am highly skilled at navigating without a gps, playing two rockband instruments at once, fixing things, ending sentences with prepositions, and listing things I'm good at. I like tall (5'10 and up is awesome), goofy, funny, and secure men who know their baggage (everyone has it).
