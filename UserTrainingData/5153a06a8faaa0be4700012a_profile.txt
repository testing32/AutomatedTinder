class, brass, and sassBack in Raleigh after 5 years in Santa Barbara, CACalifornia turned me in to a wino. Maybe Raleigh will work on the craft brew. I work in PR. I'm funny. I love (to) dance. I live-tweet the Oscars. My best friend is my dog, Soup. I just bought my first home. Comparison is the thief of joy.
