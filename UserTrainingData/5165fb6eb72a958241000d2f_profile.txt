Be brave and be patient. Have establishment in yourself; trust in the significance of your life and the purpose of your passion. You are strong enough to sit in the space between spaces and grant divine inspiration to shed some light. When you place positive energy and productive effort into the world it will come back to you. Occasionally in ways you might not immediately comprehend and on a time frame you didnt expect. Look. Listen. Learn. Stay open. Your destiny is awaiting you.I am a very independent strong minded person sometimes I come off a little to strong but once you get to know me im not that bad. "You know where my heart will always be and i know where yours will be its just a part of life"
