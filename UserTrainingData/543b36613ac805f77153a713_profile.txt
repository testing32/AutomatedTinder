This is actually a car selfie, don't be alarmed. ~*~ I love joking around. Owls Magazine once said hanging out with me was "a real hoot" (2012, citation needed). Also love: walking about, my dog, reading books 'n comics, podcasts, comedy, exercising, lattes, arts, crafts, nerd stuff, games, serialized and non-serialized television programmes, the Great Out-of-Doors, loving kindness, movies, other stuff.
