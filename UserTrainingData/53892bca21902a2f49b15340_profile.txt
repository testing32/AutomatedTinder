Drop kick awesome, NC State Grad. Addicted to laughing and having a great time. I love animals and have been working with them for 9 years. Can throw down in the kitchen when I have time. Just here to meet interesting people to hangout with, maybe grab a drink or explore. If something happens then so be it. Moved from Miami to Raleigh.
