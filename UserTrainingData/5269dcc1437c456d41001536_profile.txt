Wildlife Biologist: I want to see the whole world from the back of a snowboard , surfboard, or mountain bike . I have to buy new hiking boots every 6 months and I am always down for a  cheeseburger ...I am 5'3 so it doesn't really matter how tall you are, and I still haven't figured out why everyone is holding a fish!?
