I'm the best kind of grandma, one that'll sip whiskey neat as I knit you a hat and reminisce about the good ole days, then tipsily whip you up a cake from scratch, just because.I love coffee, puns, nighttime adventures in the great outdoors, thrifting, dad humor, cuddling with my cat, sewing, the occasional adult contemporary music indulgence, and social justice. I just got a smartphone for the first time and it terrifies me!Virginia heart, Carolina soul.
