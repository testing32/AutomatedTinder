Let's just say you better always be on your toes :) A few things about me: I'm a full figured lady with ambition to slim down this year. I am a Charlotte native, oldest of 4, NC State alum (Go Pack), 8th grade Math teacher, dog lover, beer drinker, laid back kind of girl. I love country music, the beach, and anything that doesn't require high heels (I prefer rainbows and boots). If any of this strikes your fancy, JUST SWIPE RIGHT :)
