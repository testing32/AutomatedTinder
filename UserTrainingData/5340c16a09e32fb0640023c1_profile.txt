"I'm going TINDER, it's going down...you better catch me, while you can! Let's make a night, you wont forget...I'll be the one you will remember " ^^^Don't take that the wrong way, it's just a funny rhyme I came up with for Tinder. The "Let's make a night" part means nothing sexual. I'm not here for a one night stand^^^
