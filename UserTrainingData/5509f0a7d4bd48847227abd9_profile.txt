A balanced ambivalence seems to be the running theme of my current state of being. I wear glasses but I don't. I am spontaneous but I thrive in routines. I am dry but humorous. I speak truth and people think I'm joking. I enjoy sweet and salty kettle corn popcorn. Sea salt caramel isn't bad at all.Not looking for a casual hook up. Not going to be friends with separated and/or married guys. Don't waste your time. If you want to invest your time to get to know me, try maybe.
