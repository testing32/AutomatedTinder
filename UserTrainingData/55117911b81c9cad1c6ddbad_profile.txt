Pretty sure I hate everything about this app, but my profile most of all. 5'8, atheist, feminist, vegan, whovian, dog mom, cuddler, board gamer, carrier of all of the negative personality traits. Rather Netflix than Crossfit. Likes: indie rock, books written by ribs, movies that destroy a part of your happiness (yours, not mine). DISLIKES: fedoras, Cards Against Humanity, Libertarians, paleo anything. OKC: GTFOpond
