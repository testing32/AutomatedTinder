This is so cheesy but I think you're the gratest.  I like emojis and lame humor and laffy taffy jokes and cheeseburgers and tacos and all candy except whoppers. I also like my job and margaritas and air hockey. I do not like exercise, morning people, over-communicating on text message, mayonnaise or people that are pushovers.IG: Cameron_jade
