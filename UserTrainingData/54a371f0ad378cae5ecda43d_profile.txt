Living in Carrboro, public health/med student, originally from Oregon (go Ducks!!!), rafted the Nile x 3, tirelessly convincing myself not to get a dog. Easy going, passionate about life, good sense of humor- looking for someone who is confident, can make me laugh, is excited about something, not into God, and can easily be converted to the best college football team in the nation.
