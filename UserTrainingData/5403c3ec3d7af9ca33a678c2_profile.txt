Crap, you mean this isn't FarmersOnly.com? Saw this on Conan...Love craft beer, the mountains/beach and concerts. I drive a loaded muscle car. A well traveled and educated southern bell. I'm tall so you better be taller than me. Single momma to a 3 year old girl. I work hard and play hard. I have a sarcastic and often dorky sense of humor."If you think women are the weaker sex, try pulling the blankets back to your side" -Stuart TurnerDouche bags/smokers/drug users don't waste your time
