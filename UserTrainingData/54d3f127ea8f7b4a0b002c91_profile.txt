5'6" I'm a pharmaceutical development engineer.  I spend a lot of time at the gym lifting weights. I'm pretty obsessed with health and fitness.  I eat Paleo most of the time and I'm a heck of a good cook, too!I enjoy  being outdoors, staying active, sporting events, hanging out with friends.I appreciate a gentleman.  I'm a sucker for awesome personalities.  If you're looking for a hookup, I'm not your girl.  It's just not my style.  Text me if you're interesting!
