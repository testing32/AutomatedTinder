I am who I am and I'm happily a lot! I laugh really hard and it usually begins, ends, and begins again with me gasping for air and crying tears of joy! I'm a book lover of epic proportions so I'm almost always going to think the book is better than the movie. Going to Italy feels like going home. I'm always up for a challenge and an adventure and the current one is the Tarheel 10 miler. With my dog as my running buddy, so far so good!
