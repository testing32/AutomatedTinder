Things I love: sun, beer and peanuts at baseball games, sports and working out, Tough Muddering, laffy taffy jokes, reading, a gorgeous spring day on the golf course (well any day on the golf course really), my family, friends, dogs, and job (I work in the sports industry), traveling. Jesus is my home-boy.
