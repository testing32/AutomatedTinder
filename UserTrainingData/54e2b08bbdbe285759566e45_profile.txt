I'm a student at Duke Law.  Please don't talk to me about legal issues, or anything else that is boring and lame.  I eat ice cream for breakfast and French fries for dinner, but you need to pretend like I don't.  There is a 95% chance I would rather be at home on Reddit at any given time.  I spend way too much on clothes and shoes.  Scrubs and suits are sexy.  Please swipe left if you would describe yourself as a country boy or Southern gentleman. I love jokes, novels, and white wine.
