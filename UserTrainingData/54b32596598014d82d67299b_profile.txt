Meh, I'm a mom. I rarely ever get 'me' time. I change my hair color often because I tire of my average appearance. I'm a Leo. I do not own sweat pants. I am 'tall for a girl' I love comedy clubs. I adore tall country boys with a gentle nature. I want to go mud bogging desperately.No, I will not text you. Most of you people are insane.   I cannot deal with immaturity or individuals that are so consumed in themselves they believe they're a gift to the world
