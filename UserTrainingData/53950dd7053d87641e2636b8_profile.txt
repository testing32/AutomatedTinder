If your first photo includes an assault rifle, I'm swiping left because I'm scared. Adorable dog pics & a creative bio may be your only redemption. Creative, little nerdy/techie, alotta corny, sometimes inappropriate, political junkie, social drinker, nature lover, girly girl, mother of boys, gym rat, Packers fan, live music seeker, future world traveler. 5'5 & most often in heels or wedges. But first, let me take a selfie...PS - I'm in the center laughing in the large group shot.
