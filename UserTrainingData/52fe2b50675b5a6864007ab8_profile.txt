Finish every day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt have crept in; forget them as soon as you can.

It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on yesterdays." - Ralph Waldo EmersonAnd, although I absolutely adore her, that's my niece, not my daughter.
