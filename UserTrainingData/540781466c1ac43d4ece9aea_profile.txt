Recently relocated from Scottsdale, AZ! I've got a great job, educated, and I love my family! I really don't have time for games so please don't waste either of our time if that's on your agenda. I'm not a big drinker or club/bar goer so don't be offended if I decline drinks. I am a huge football fan so if you like the Cardinals and the Sun Devils you get brownie points. I'm moving back home this summer so I'm not looking for anything serious at this point! Looking for friends :)
