Looking for a friendship that grows into more. Love Jesus. Super close to my family. One spoiled-rotten dog. Love my career. Work way too much. Love cooking, movies, theatre, music, and painting. Would love to take dance classes. Drive too fast. Protective of and loyal to those in my circle. Opinionated. Stubborn. Out-spoken. Strong-willed. Fiercely independent.  A blend of Lee Brice's "She Ain't Right" and Raelynn's "God Made Girls".
